# Puff

Nodejs Cross-platform screen sharing addon with incredible performance. Written with C++.


This project still in development and only supports on Node.js or Electron based environment only.
I'll extend supporting environment for Web based environment!

cd ./Puff
npm install
```
or

```

## Usage

```js
var puff = require("puff");

// Call getAvailableWindows() to retrive captureable windows
// you can use getAvailableScreens if you want to capture Screen instead of Window.
var captureTargets = puff.getAvailableWindows();
```

## Building

npm run -- node-gyp build # <-- It just build addon only. not effects on dependencies.
